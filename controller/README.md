# controller

This is the Flynn Controller. It is inspired by the [Heroku Platform
API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference) and enables
management of applications running on Flynn via an HTTP API.

The controller depends on PostgreSQL and is typically booted by
[bootstrap](/bootstrap).

The API is in a state of flux and is undocumented.
[cli](/cli) is one of the API consumers.
