SKIP32 is a 32-bit block cipher by Greg Rose, based on the SKIPJACK cipher.  It
is useful for performing simple integer obfuscation, for example disguising
sequential database ids.

This routines exposed by this library are for performing this sort of
obfuscating, and specfically do not implement the standard cipher.Block
interface.

It also includes routines for disguising 64-bit integers, but with a larger
block size there's no reason not to use a standard block cipher.
