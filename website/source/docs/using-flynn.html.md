# Using Flynn

This guide assumes you already have a running Flynn cluster and have configured
the `flynn` command-line tool. If this is not the case, follow the [Installation
Guide](/docs/installation) first to get things set up.

It also assumes you are using the `demo.localflynn.com` default domain (which is
the case if you installed the demo environment). If you are using your own
domain, substitute `demo.localflynn.com` with whatever you set `CLUSTER_DOMAIN`
to during the bootstrap process.

## Add SSH key

Before deploying to Flynn, you need to add your public SSH key:

```
$ flynn key add
Key dd:31:2c:07:33:fb:93:32:2b:cc:fa:87:a4:0f:00:34 added.
```

*See [here](/docs/cli#key) for more information on the `flynn key` command.*

## Deploy

We will deploy a Node.js example application which starts a minimal HTTP server.

Clone the Git repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/flynn/nodejs-flynn-example.git
```

Inside the cloned repo, create a Flynn application:

```
$ cd nodejs-flynn-example
$ flynn create example
Created example
```

The above command should have added a `flynn` Git remote:

```
$ git remote -v
flynn   ssh://git@demo.localflynn.com:2222/example.git (push)
flynn   ssh://git@demo.localflynn.com:2222/example.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/flynn/nodejs-flynn-example.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/flynn/nodejs-flynn-example.git (push)
```

It should also have added a default route of `example.demo.localflynn.com` pointing
at the `example-web` service:

```
$ flynn route
ROUTE                             SERVICE      ID
http:example.demo.localflynn.com  example-web  http/1ba949d1654e711d03b5f1e471426512
```

Push to the `flynn` Git remote to deploy the application:

```
$ git push flynn master
...
-----> Building example...
-----> Node.js app detected
...
-----> Creating release...
=====> Application deployed
=====> Added default web=1 formation
To ssh://git@demo.localflynn.com:2222/example.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

Now the application is deployed, you can make HTTP requests to it using the
default route for the application:

```
$ curl http://example.demo.localflynn.com
Hello from Flynn on port 55006 from container d55c7a2d5ef542c186e0feac5b94a0b0
```

## Scale

Applications declare their process types in a `Procfile` in the root directory. The
example application declares a single `web` process type which executes `web.js`:

```
$ cat Procfile
web: node web.js
```

New applications with a `web` process type are initially scaled to run one web
process, as can be seen with the `ps` command:

```
$ flynn ps
ID                                      TYPE
flynn-d55c7a2d5ef542c186e0feac5b94a0b0  web
```

Run more web processes using the `scale` command:

```
$ flynn scale web=3
```

`ps` should now show three running processes:

```
$ flynn ps
ID                                      TYPE
flynn-7c540dffaa7e434db3849280ed5ba020  web
flynn-3e8572dd4e5f4136a6a2243eadca5e02  web
flynn-d55c7a2d5ef542c186e0feac5b94a0b0  web
```

Repeated HTTP requests should show that the requests are load balanced across
those processes:

```
$ curl http://example.demo.localflynn.com
Hello from Flynn on port 55006 from container d55c7a2d5ef542c186e0feac5b94a0b0

$ curl http://example.demo.localflynn.com
Hello from Flynn on port 55007 from container 3e8572dd4e5f4136a6a2243eadca5e02

$ curl http://example.demo.localflynn.com
Hello from Flynn on port 55008 from container 7c540dffaa7e434db3849280ed5ba020

$ curl http://example.demo.localflynn.com
Hello from Flynn on port 55007 from container 3e8572dd4e5f4136a6a2243eadca5e02
```

## Logs

You can view the logs (i.e. stdout / stderr) of a job using the `log` command:

```
$ flynn log flynn-d55c7a2d5ef542c186e0feac5b94a0b0
Listening on 55006
```

*See [here](/docs/cli#log) for more information on the `flynn log` command.*

## Redeploy

Updating your application and publishing your changes is done by committing 
changes to Git and pushing those changes to Flynn.

Add the following line to the top of `web.js`:

```js
console.log("I've made a change!")
```

Commit that to Git and push the changes to Flynn:

```
$ git add web.js
$ git commit -m "Add log message"
$ git push flynn master
```

Once that push has succeeded, you should now see 3 new processes:


```
$ flynn ps
ID                                      TYPE
flynn-cf834b6db8bb4514a34372c8b0020b1e  web
flynn-16f2725f165343fca22a65eebab4e230  web
flynn-d7893da39a8847f395ce47f024479145  web
```

The logs of those processes should show the added log message:

```
$ flynn log flynn-cf834b6db8bb4514a34372c8b0020b1e
I've made a change!
Listening on 55007
```

## Routes

On creation, applications get a default route which is a subdomain of the default
route domain (e.g. `example.demo.localflynn.com`). If you want to use a different
domain, you will need to add another route.

Let's say you have a domain `example.com` which is pointed at your Flynn cluster
(e.g. it is a `CNAME` for `example.demo.localflynn.com`).

Add a route for that domain:

```
$ flynn route add http example.com
http/5ababd603b22780302dd8d83498e5172
```

You should now have two routes for your application:

```
$ flynn route
ROUTE                             SERVICE      ID
http:example.com                  example-web  http/5ababd603b22780302dd8d83498e5172
http:example.demo.localflynn.com  example-web  http/1ba949d1654e711d03b5f1e471426512
```

HTTP requests to `example.com` should be routed to the web processes:

```
$ curl http://example.com
Hello from Flynn on port 55007 from container cf834b6db8bb4514a34372c8b0020b1e
```

You could now modify your application to respond differently based on the HTTP Host
header (which here could be either `example.demo.localflynn.com` or `example.com`).

## Multiple Processes

So far the example application has only had one process type (i.e. the `web` process),
but applications can have multiple process types which can be scaled individuallly.

Lets add a simple `clock` service which will print the time every second.

Add the following to `clock.js`:

```js
setInterval(function() {
  console.log(new Date().toTimeString());
}, 1000);
```

Create the `clock` process type by adding the following to `Procfile`:

```
clock: node clock.js
```

Release these changes:

```
$ git add clock.js Procfile
$ git commit -m "Add clock service"
$ git push flynn master
```

Scale the `clock` service to one process and get its output:

```
$ flynn scale clock=1

$ flynn ps
ID                                      TYPE
flynn-aff3ae71d0c149b185ec64ea2885075f  clock
flynn-cf834b6db8bb4514a34372c8b0020b1e  web
flynn-16f2725f165343fca22a65eebab4e230  web
flynn-d7893da39a8847f395ce47f024479145  web

$ flynn log flynn-aff3ae71d0c149b185ec64ea2885075f
18:40:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
18:40:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
18:40:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
18:40:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
18:40:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
...
```

## Run

An interactive one-off process may be spawned in a container:

```
$ flynn run bash
```

*See [here](/docs/cli#run) for more information on the `flynn run` command.*


## Release existing Docker images

Releasing pre-built Docker images is possible by passing the image URL and image 
id or tag, and optionally, the username/password for the registry to Flynn. Flynn
supports both auth basic for self hosted private registries and private repositories
on the official Docker Registry.

First, you'll need to create a configuration file for your release. This file may 
contain all relevant information such as which command to run,  which environment
variables to set and which port to route. If 'port' is left out; the next available port
will be assigned.

The process in the container will need to bind to the port that is assigned to it. It 
will be available under the $PORT environment variable.

Your json file may look like this:

```
{
    "processes": {
        "env" {"FOO": "bar"},
        "sshd": {
            "cmd": ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo starting sshd on port $PORT; /usr/sbin/sshd -D -p $PORT"],
            "ports": [{"proto": "tcp", "port": 22222}]
        }
    }
}
```

Now create the service placeholder on the flynn cluster.
```
$ flynn create sshd
```

And add the 'release'. Note that we add the tag to the URL, a tag, or image id is required. 
We use -a to specify the service.

```
$ flynn -a sshd release add -f sshd.json https://registry.hub.docker.com/dhrp/sshd?tag=latest
Created release 24c788b26ad54e97b2ab901a042a78c9.
```

And finally, to actually start the service we'll need to scale it to at least one instance.

```
$ flynn -a sshd scale sshd=1
```

Wait for the image to pull and start, then check it's status with:
```
$ flynn -a sshd ps

# Connect
$ ssh root@<hostname> -p 22222
```
