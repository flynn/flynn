# Development

This guide will explain how to:

* Make changes to the Flynn source code
* Build and run Flynn
* Run the tests
* Create a release of Flynn

## Development environment

Development work is typically done inside a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM managed
by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and Flynn includes a Vagrantfile which fully automates
the creation of the VM.

### Running the development VM

If you don't already have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, you should
install them by following the directions on their respective web sites.

Clone the Flynn source code locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/flynn/flynn.git
```

Then, inside the `flynn` directory, bring up the VM:

```
$ vagrant up
```

If this is the first time you are creating the VM, Vagrant will need to download the
underlying VirtualBox files which are ~1GB in size, so this could take a while depending on
your internet connection.

Once that command has finished, you will have a VM running which you can SSH to:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

From now on, it is assumed that commands will be run inside the VM, unless otherwise stated.

## Making code changes

The development VM is configured to share the Flynn source code from your machine and mount
it at `/vagrant`, meaning you can edit files locally on your machine and those changes
will be visible inside the VM.

Since Flynn is primarily written in Go, the source code needs to be inside a valid Go workspace.
The development VM has a `GOPATH` of `$HOME/go` and the Flynn source code is symlinked from
`/vagrant` to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/flynn/flynn`.

If you don't have a specific issue you are trying to fix, but are interested in contributing
to the project, you should start by looking at GitHub issues labelled
[easy](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/labels/easy).

## Building Flynn

We use the [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/) build system to run the commands which build the various
components of Flynn.

To kickoff the build process, just run `make`:

```
$ make
```

This will do things like build Go binaries and create Docker images. If you're interested in
exactly what will be built, take a look at the `Tupfiles` in various subdirectories.

If any build command fails, `tup` will output an error and abort the entire build. You can then
fix the issue and then re-run `make`.

If you want to rebuild all Go binaries, run `make clean`.

Once tup runs successfully, you will have a number of built Go binaries and Docker images which
can be used to run Flynn.

## Running Flynn

Once you have built all the Flynn components, you can boot a single node Flynn cluster by running
the following script:

```
$ script/bootstrap-flynn
```

This will do the following:

* stop the `flynn-host` daemon and any running Flynn services
* start the `flynn-host` daemon, which will in turn start etcd and discoverd
* run the Flynn bootstrapper, which will start all the Flynn Layer 1 services

If you want to boot Flynn using a different job backend, or an external IP other
than that of the `eth0` device, the script provides some options for doing so.
See `script/bootstrap-flynn -h` for a full list of supported options.

Once Flynn is running, you can add the cluster to the `flynn` CLI tool using the
bootstrap output, and then try out your changes (e.g. by following [this guide]
(https://github.com/flynn/flynn#trying-it-out)).

## Debugging

If things don't seem to be running as expected, here are some useful commands to help
diagnose the issue:

### check the flynn-host daemon log

```
$ less /tmp/flynn-host.log
```

### view running jobs

```
$ flynn-host ps

### view all jobs (i.e. running + stopped)

```
$ flynn-host ps -a

### view the output of a job

```
$ flynn-host log $JOBID

```

### inspect a job

```
$ flynn-host inspect $JOBID

### stop a job

```
$ flynn-host stop $JOBID
```

### stop all jobs

```
$ flynn-host ps -a | xargs flynn-host stop
```

*(NOTE: as jobs are stopped, the scheduler may start new jobs. To avoid this, stop the scehduler first)*

### stop all jobs for a particular app

Assuming the app has name `example`:

```
$ flynn-host ps | awk -F " {2,}" '$4=="example" {print $1}' | xargs flynn-host stop
```

### upload logs and system information to a gist

If you want to get help diagnosing issues on your system, run the following to upload some
useful information to an anonymous gist:

```
$ flynn-host upload-debug-info
14:45:55.596680 upload-debug-info.go:69: Debug information uploaded to: https://gist.github.com/877117544439b0acaf0e
```

You can then post the gist in the `#flynn` IRC room when asking for assistance to make it easier for
someone to help you.

## Running tests

Flynn has two types of tests:

* "unit" tests which are run using `go test`
* "integration" tests which run against a booted Flynn cluster

### Run the unit tests

To run all the unit tests:


```
$ go test ./...
```

To run tests for an individual component (e.g. the router):

```
$ go test ./router
```

To run tests for a component and all sub-components (e.g. the controller):

```
$ go test ./controller/...
```

### Run the integration tests

The integration tests live in the `tests` directory, and require a running Flynn
cluster before they can run.

To run all the integration tests:

```
$ script/run-integration-tests
```

This will:

* Run `make` to build Flynn
* Boot a single node Flynn cluster by running `script/bootstrap-flynn`
* Run the integration test binary (i.e. `bin/flynn-test`)

To run an individual integration test (e.g. `TestEnvDir`):

```
$ script/run-integration-tests -f TestEnvDir
```

## Releasing Flynn

Once you have built and tested Flynn inside the development VM, you can create a release
and install the components on other hosts (e.g. in EC2).

A Flynn release consists of a package (currently only Debian packages are supported) and the
built Docker images, and both of these must be installed in order to run Flynn.

### Docker Registry

By default, Flynn will reference Docker images from the default Docker registry using
the `flynn` user.

This needs to be changed in order to release your own images, which can be done
by changing `CONFIG_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX` in the `tup.config` file then re-running
`make`.

To use the default Docker registry but with a different user (e.g. `lmars`):

```
CONFIG_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX=https://registry.hub.docker.com/lmars
```

To use a different Docker registry:

```
CONFIG_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX=https://my.registry.com/flynn
```

If the registry requires HTTP basic authentication, put the credentials in the URL:

```
CONFIG_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX=https://username:password@my.registry.com
```

### Create Package

Create a Debian package of the built files by running the following:

```
$ script/build-deb $(date +%Y%m%d)
```

*Note: The argument to the `build-deb` script is the version of the flynn-host package.
You can set this to whatever you wish, provided it conforms to [Debian versioning]
(https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version).*

This creates a `.deb` file in the current directory which can be installed on other
systems.

### Upload Images

Log in to the Docker registry:

```
$ docker login
```

If you are using a different registry in `CONFIG_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX`, log in to that
registry instead:

```
docker login my.registry.com
```

Upload the images:

```
$ util/release/flynn-release upload images.json
```

You can now follow the [installation instructions](/docs/installation#ubuntu-14.04-amd64)
to install your custom components, replacing the `apt-get install flynn-host` step with the
installation of the custom Debian package (i.e. `dpkg -i /path/to/flynn-host.deb`).

## Pull request

Once you have made changes to the Flynn source code and tested your changes, you
should open a pull request on GitHub so we can review your changes and merge
them into the Flynn repository.

Please see the [contribution guide](/docs/contributing) for more information.
