# Flynn Roadmap

Flynn will be the fastest and easiest way to deploy apps in your organization with a web dashboard everyone can understand. But before we can add more features, Flynn needs to be stable enough to run in production.

Flynn is currently unstable and not suitable for production environments.

Our current focus is on test coverage, stability, and security so Flynn will be production-ready as soon as possible.

## What's going to change

Many Flynn components are currently prototypes and are expected to change substantially in the coming months. These include Flynn's RPC system, container management, and all APIs. Users are cautioned against investing resources into integration with these features before long term stability can be assured.

## Short term goals

After Flynn is ready for production, development will focus on appliances for major open source databases, operator tooling, log aggregation, user ACLs, and diagnostic tools.

## Later

Lots of other new features are coming, too. Log aggregation, metrics, faster builds, multi datacenter support, and more.

Flynn is so modular that it isn't even tied to Linux or containers. Eventually you'll be able to run Flynn on other operating systems and use it to manage VMs and other types of jobs.

You will forget how many different tools you had to use before Flynn.
