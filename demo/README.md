# Flynn Demo Environment

This repo contains a Vagrantfile that boots up Flynn layer 0 and then bootstraps
Flynn layer 1.

You need to have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/),
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), and [XZ Utils](http://tukaani.org/xz/)
installed.

### Setup

Check out this repo, and boot up the VM using Vagrant:

```text
git clone https://github.com/flynn/flynn
cd flynn/demo
vagrant up
```

If you see an error unpackaging the box, you need to install `xz` (`brew install
xz` or `apt-get install xz-utils`). If running on Windows, update to Vagrant 1.6.

The final log line contains configuration details used to access Flynn via the
command line tool. Install the [CLI](/cli), and paste the `flynn server-add`
command into your terminal.

### Usage

With the Flynn running and the `flynn` tool installed, the first thing you'll
want to do is add your SSH key so that you can deploy applications:

```text
flynn key-add
```

After adding your ssh key, you can deploy a new application:

```text
git clone https://github.com/flynn/nodejs-flynn-example
cd nodejs-flynn-example
flynn create example
git push flynn master
```

#### Scale

To access the application, add some web processes using the `scale`
command and a route with `route-add-http`:

```text
flynn scale web=3

flynn route-add-http localhost:8080
```

Visit the application [in your browser](http://localhost:8080) or with curl:

```text
curl localhost:8080
```

Repeated requests via curl should show that the requests are load balanced
across the running processes.

#### Logs

`flynn ps` will show the running processes:

```text
$ flynn ps
ID                                             TYPE
e4cffae4ce2b-8cb1212f582f498eaed467fede768d6f  web
e4cffae4ce2b-da9c86b1e9e743f2acd5793b151dcf99  web
e4cffae4ce2b-1b17dd7be8e44ca1a76259a7bca244e1  web
```

To get the log from a process, use `flynn log`:

```text
$ flynn log e4cffae4ce2b-8cb1212f582f498eaed467fede768d6f
Listening on 55007
```

#### Run

An interactive one-off process may be spawned in a container:

```text
flynn run bash
```
