package volume

/*
	A Volume is a persistent and sharable filesystem.  Unlike most of the filesystem in a job's
	container, which is ephemeral and is discarded after job termination, Volumes can be used to
	store data and may be reconnected to a later job (or to multiple jobs).

	Volumes may also support additional features for their section of the filesystem, such
	storage quotas, read-only mounts, snapshotting operation, etc.

	The Flynn host service maintains a locally persistent knowledge
	of mounts, and supplies this passively to the orchestration API.
	The host service does *not* perform services such as garbage collection of unmounted
	volumes (how is it to know whether you still want that data preserved for a future job?)
	or transport and persistence of volumes between hosts (that should be orchestrated via
	the API from a higher level service).
