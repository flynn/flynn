# Flynn is Unmaintained

Flynn is no longer being developed.

All public Flynn-related infrastructure including binary release hosting and cluster discovery will be shut down on June 1, 2021. This means that **installation of the CLI and deployments of new server hosts will fail starting on June 1**. Running hosts will not be impacted.

Flynn will no longer receive security updates, we strongly recommend transitioning to another system as soon as possible.

We thank everyone for their support and engagement over the years, and we're sorry that we won't be able to continue developing the platform.
