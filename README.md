Flynn is designed to run anything that can run on Linux, not just stateless web
apps. Flynn comes with highly available database appliances, including
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

Eventually we want Flynn to be the only tool developers and ops teams need to
develop, deploy, and manage running software.

You can learn more about Flynn at [our website](https://flynn.io).

The Flynn website also has [documentation](https://flynn.io/docs).

### Status
