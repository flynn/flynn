# PostgreSQL

The Flynn Postgres appliance provides PostgreSQL 9.4 in a highly-available
configuration with automatic provisioning. It automatically fails over to
a synchronous replica with no loss of data if the primary server goes down.

## Usage

### Adding a database to an app

Postgres comes ready to go as soon as you've installed Flynn. After you create
an app, you can provision a database for your app by running:

```text
flynn resource add postgres
```

This will provision a database on the Postgres cluster and configure your
application to connect to it.

### Connecting to the database

Provisioning the database will add a few environment variables to your app
release. `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, and `PGHOST` provide connection
details for the database and are used automatically by many Postgres clients.

#### DATABASE_URL

If your application expects a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, you can
create one by combining the `PG*` variables:

```text
flynn env set DATABASE_URL=$(export $(flynn env | xargs); echo "postgres://$PGUSER:$PGPASSWORD@$PGHOST:5432/$PGDATABASE")
```

### Connecting to a console

To connect to a `psql` console for the database, run `flynn pg psql`. This does not
require the Postgres client to be installed locally or firewall/security
changes, as it runs in a container on the Flynn cluster.

### Connecting via External Tools such as pgAdmin

To access a provisioned database via external tools such as pgAdmin you should use SSH
tunneling. For SSH Tunnel details, use SSH credentials you use to access host machine.
For database details use values of environmental variables by executing following
commands:

```text
$ flynn run host `flynn env get PGHOST`
$ flynn env get PGDATABASE
$ flynn env get PGUSER
$ flynn env get PGPASSWORD
```

### Dumping and restoring

The Flynn CLI provides commands for exporting and restoring database dumps.

`flynn pg dump` saves a complete copy of the database schema and data to a local file.

```text
$ flynn pg dump -f latest.dump
60.34 MB 8.77 MB/s
```

The file can be used to restore the database with `flynn pg restore`. It
may also be imported into a local Postgres database that is not managed by Flynn
with `pg_restore`:

```text
$ pg_restore --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d mydb latest.dump
```

`flynn pg restore` loads a database dump from a local file into a Flynn Postgres
database. Any existing tables and database objects will be dropped before they
are recreated.

```text
$ flynn pg restore -f latest.dump
62.29 MB / 62.29 MB [===================] 100.00 % 4.96 MB/s
WARNING: errors ignored on restore: 4
```

This will generate some warnings, but they are generally safe to ignore.

The restore command may also be used to restore a database dump from another non-Flynn
Postgres database, use `pg_dump` to create a dump file:

```text
$ pg_dump --format=custom --no-acl --no-owner mydb > mydb.dump
```

### Extensions

The Flynn Postgres appliance comes configured with many extensions available
including hstore, PostGIS, and PLV8. To enable an extension, use `CREATE
EXTENSION`:

```text
$ flynn pg psql
psql (9.4.1)
Type "help" for help.

bbabc090024fcdd118b04c50a0fb0d8c=> CREATE EXTENSION hstore;
CREATE EXTENSION
bbabc090024fcdd118b04c50a0fb0d8c=>
```

## Design

The Flynn Postgres appliance was designed with a few goals in mind:

1. Acknowledged writes must not be lost and must be consistent.
1. Network partitions must be tolerated without corrupting data. There should be
   no potential for split-brain or other data-mangling failures.
1. When a failure occurs, the appliance should transition into an available
   configuration without operator intervention if it can do so safely.

The resulting system can be described as a 'CP' system under [CAP
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem). The appliance is a cluster
of three or more Postgres instances where:

- One member of the cluster, the _primary_, serves consistent reads and writes.
- The primary has synchronous replication to a single member called the _sync_.
  Write transactions are not acknowledged to client until they have been added
  to the sync's transaction log.
- Replicating from the sync is a daisy chain of one or more _async_ instances,
  which replicate changes asynchronously from their upstream link in the chain.
- If possible, the system automatically reconfigures itself after failures to
  maximize uptime and never lose data.

In the face of an arbitrary failure or maintenance action, the cluster can
temporarily lose the ability to handle writes and consistent reads. Eventually
consistent reads are always available from the sync and async instances.

If the primary fails, the sync sees this and promotes itself to primary,
converting the async replicating from it to the new sync. Writes are not
accepted until the new sync has caught up. A variety of safety conditions are in
place so that a promotion will never cause writes to be lost or split brain to
occur.

The built-in Postgres streaming write ahead log replication features are wrapped
in a cluster state machine to achieve this. The cluster state is maintained by
the primary and stored in discoverd. The discoverd DNS and HTTP APIs expose the
current primary instance.

This design is heavily based on the prior work done by Joyent on the [Manatee
state machine](https://github.com/joyent/manatee-state-machine).

Flynn comes with a cluster configured with three instances by default. If an
instance fails, the scheduler will create a new instance and the cluster will be
reconfigured by the primary without operator intervention. When a user runs
`flynn resource add postgres`, a new user and database is created on the default
cluster.
