# Trademark Guidelines

Prime Directive, Inc. (“Flynn”) trademarks, service marks and logos (“our Marks”) are valuable assets that Flynn needs to protect. Flynn has posted these Trademark Usage Guidelines (“Guidelines”) to assist you in properly using our Marks. The strength of our Marks depends, in part, upon consistent and appropriate use. We ask that you properly use and credit our Marks in accordance with these Guidelines. We reserve the right to change these Guidelines at anytime and solely at our discretion.

## The Marks

Our Marks consist of the following registered, unregistered and/or pending trademarks, service marks and logos which are subject to change without notice: Flynn, the Flynn logo, and other marks which may be referred to in your specific license agreement or otherwise.


### Do not create composite marks

Our Marks must not appear to be part of any other marks (whether words or logos). Our Marks may not be used in any variations or as a design feature on your product, packaging, web page or promotional materials without obtaining prior written approval. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, if our Marks are used in connection with your mark, the use must be in a manner that distinguishes your mark from our Marks. Variations of our Marks may confuse consumers as to the source of the goods or services bearing the altered mark, and such use may infringe our trademark rights and be actionable under applicable laws.

## Prohibited Trademark Uses

Flynn does not permit using any of our Marks in the following manner: as part of your own trademark; to identify non-Flynn products, services or technology; in a manner likely to cause confusion between products, services or technology of Flynn and those of another entity; in a manner that inaccurately implies that Flynn sponsors or endorses or otherwise is affiliated with your own activities, products, services or technology; in a manner that disparages Flynn or its products, services or technology; in connection with products, services or activities which, in our judgment, may diminish goodwill in our Marks; in connection with any unlawful activities or to encourage unlawful activities.

## Websites and Domain Name Uses

Proper use of our Marks on websites to name or accurately describe Flynn’s products, services or technology is permitted. The use of our Marks should not be misleading or likely to cause confusion as to whether the website is sponsored by or affiliated with Flynn or whether the products, services or technology are offered by Flynn. Any principal or secondary level domain name should not be identical to or virtually identical to any of our Marks. The website owner should not register any domain name containing our Marks and should not claim any trademark or similar proprietary rights in the domain name. The website should display a legal notice or a link that contains the following legend:

“Flynn and the Flynn logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Prime Directive, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries. Prime Directive, Inc. and other parties may also have trademark rights in other terms used herein.”

This legend can be modified to include only our Marks. The website should otherwise comply with domain name registry policies and applicable laws regarding trademark infringement and dilution.

## Requests For Permission

You may make limited fair use of our Marks in naming or referring to our products, services or technology, for example in a magazine article, without our permission, provided you follow these Guidelines. All other uses are prohibited except by express written permission, requested in advance, which we may grant or deny in our sole discretion. To request permission please contact Flynn’s Legal Department by email at legal@flynn.io. Flynn will attempt to evaluate requests promptly. Flynn reserves the right to refuse permission to use our Marks for any reason.

## Restricted Use That Requires A Trademark License Prior to Use

The Flynn code is available under the BSD 3-clause license. Although the BSD license permits third parties to copy and redistribute the underlying software under the terms of the license, the BSD license does not provide any license or right to use any of the Flynn Marks. Thus, the licensee may redistribute the Flynn software under the terms of the BSD license, but may not use the Flynn Marks without express written permission from Prime Directive, Inc. or as expressly permitted in this Trademark Policy.

## Review By Flynn

Flynn reserves the right to review all uses of our Marks by others and to conduct periodic spot checks of such use. Upon request from Flynn, you must provide a copy of any product, packaging, screenshot, or other materials bearing our Mark. You must correct any deficiencies in the use of our Marks. Refusal to correct such deficiencies may result in revocation of permission to use the Mark.
