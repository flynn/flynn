# Development

This guide will explain how to:

* Make changes to the Flynn source code
* Build and run Flynn
* Run the tests
* Create a release of Flynn

## Development environment

Development work is typically done inside a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM managed
by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and Flynn includes a Vagrantfile which fully automates
the creation of the VM.

### Running the development VM

If you don't already have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, you should
install them by following the directions on their respective web sites.

Clone the Flynn source code locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/flynn/flynn.git
```

Then, inside the `flynn` directory, bring up the VM:

```
$ vagrant up
```

If this is the first time you are creating the VM, Vagrant will need to download the
underlying VirtualBox files which are ~1GB in size, so this could take a while depending on
your internet connection.

Once that command has finished, you will have a VM running which you can SSH to:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

From now on, it is assumed that commands will be run inside the VM, unless otherwise stated.

## Making code changes

The development VM is configured to share the Flynn source code from your machine and mount
it inside the VM, meaning you can edit files locally on your machine and those changes
will be visible inside the VM.

Since Flynn is primarily written in Go, the source code needs to be inside a valid Go workspace.
The development VM has a `GOPATH` of `$HOME/go` and the Flynn source code is synchronized into
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/flynn/flynn`.

If you don't have a specific issue you are trying to fix, but are interested in contributing
to the project, you should start by looking at GitHub issues labelled
[complexity/easy](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/labels/complexity/easy).

## Building Flynn

We use the [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/) build system to run the commands which build the various
components of Flynn.

To kickoff the build process, just run `make`:

```
$ make
```

This will do things like build Go binaries and create Docker images. If you're interested in
exactly what will be built, take a look at the `Tupfiles` in various subdirectories.

If any build command fails, `tup` will output an error and abort the entire build. You can then
fix the issue and then re-run `make`.

If you want to rebuild all Go binaries, run `make clean`.

Once tup runs successfully, you will have a number of built Go binaries and Docker images which
can be used to run Flynn.

## Running Flynn

Once you have built all the Flynn components, you can boot a single node Flynn cluster by running
the following script:

```
$ script/bootstrap-flynn
```

This will do the following:

* stop the `flynn-host` daemon and any running Flynn services
* start the `flynn-host` daemon
* run the Flynn bootstrapper, which will start all of the Flynn services

If you want to boot Flynn using a different job backend, or an external IP other
than that of the `eth0` device, the script provides some options for doing so.
See `script/bootstrap-flynn -h` for a full list of supported options.

Once Flynn is running, you can add the cluster to the `flynn` CLI tool using the
bootstrap output, and then try out your changes.

## Debugging

If things don't seem to be running as expected, here are some useful commands to help
diagnose the issue:

### check the flynn-host daemon log

```
$ less /tmp/flynn-host.log
```

### view running jobs

```
$ flynn-host ps

### stop a job

```
$ flynn-host stop $JOBID
```

### stop all jobs

```
$ flynn-host ps -a | xargs flynn-host stop
```

*(NOTE: as jobs are stopped, the scheduler may start new jobs. To avoid this, stop the scheduler first)*

### stop all jobs for a particular app

Assuming the app has name `example`:

```
$ flynn-host ps | awk -F " {2,}" '$4=="example" {print $1}' | xargs flynn-host stop
```

### upload logs and system information to a GitHub gist

If you want to get help diagnosing issues on your system, run the following to upload some
useful information to an anonymous GitHub gist:

```
$ flynn-host collect-debug-info
INFO[03-11|19:25:29] uploading logs and debug information to a private, anonymous gist
INFO[03-11|19:25:29] this may take a while depending on the size of your logs
INFO[03-11|19:25:29] getting flynn-host logs
INFO[03-11|19:25:29] getting job logs
INFO[03-11|19:25:29] getting system information
INFO[03-11|19:25:30] creating anonymous gist
789.50 KB / 789.50 KB [=======================================================] 100.00 % 93.39 KB/s 8s
INFO[03-11|19:25:38] debug information uploaded to: https://gist.github.com/47379bd4604442cac820
```

You can then post the gist in the `#flynn` IRC room when asking for assistance to make it easier for
someone to help you.

If you would rather not use the GitHub gist service, or your logs are too big to fit into a single gist,
you can create a tarball of the information by specifying the `--tarball` flag:

```
$ flynn-host collect-debug-info --tarball
INFO[03-11|19:28:58] creating a tarball containing logs and debug information
INFO[03-11|19:28:58] this may take a while depending on the size of your logs
INFO[03-11|19:28:58] getting flynn-host logs
INFO[03-11|19:28:58] getting job logs
INFO[03-11|19:28:58] getting system information
INFO[03-11|19:28:59] created tarball containing debug information at /tmp/flynn-host-debug407848418/flynn-host-debug.tar.gz
```

You can then send this to a Flynn developer after speaking to them in IRC.

## Running tests

Flynn has two types of tests:

* "unit" tests which are run using `go test`
* "integration" tests which run against a booted Flynn cluster

### Run the unit tests

To run all the unit tests:


```
$ go test ./...
```

To run tests for an individual component (e.g. the router):

```
$ go test ./router
```

To run tests for a component and all sub-components (e.g. the controller):

```
$ go test ./controller/...
```

### Run the integration tests

The integration tests live in the `tests` directory, and require a running Flynn
cluster before they can run.

To run all the integration tests:

```
$ script/run-integration-tests
```

This will:

* Run `make` to build Flynn
* Boot a single node Flynn cluster by running `script/bootstrap-flynn`
* Run the integration test binary (i.e. `bin/flynn-test`)

To run an individual integration test (e.g. `TestEnvDir`):

```
$ script/run-integration-tests -f TestEnvDir
```

## Pull request

Once you have made changes to the Flynn source code and tested your changes, you
should open a pull request on GitHub so we can review your changes and merge
them into the Flynn repository.

Please see the [contribution guide](/docs/contributing) for more information.

## Releasing Flynn

Once you have built and tested Flynn inside the development VM, you can create a release
and install the components on other hosts (e.g. in EC2).

A Flynn release is a set of components consisting of binaries, configuration files and
filesystem images, all of which must be installed in order to run Flynn.

### The Update Framework (TUF)

Flynn uses [The Update Framework](http://theupdateframework.com/) (also known as TUF) to
securely distribute all of the Flynn components.

To release Flynn, you will need to generate a TUF repository using the
[go-tuf](https://github.com/flynn/go-tuf) library.

Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/flynn/go-tuf#install)
and then follow the ["Create signed root manifest"](https://github.com/flynn/go-tuf#examples)
example. You should now have a directory with the following layout:


```
.
├── keys
│   ├── snapshot.json
│   ├── targets.json
│   └── timestamp.json
├── repository
└── staged
    ├── root.json
    └── targets
```

The TUF root keys need to be compiled into the Flynn release, and image URLs must
be relative to the file server the TUF repository will be uploaded to. This can be
accomplished by setting `CONFIG_TUF_ROOT_KEYS` and `CONFIG_IMAGE_REPOSITORY` in
the `tup.config` file then re-running `make`, e.g.:

```
CONFIG_IMAGE_REPOSITORY=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-flynn-repo/tuf
CONFIG_TUF_ROOT_KEYS=[{"keytype":"ed25519","keyval":{"public":"31351ecc833417968faabf98e004d1ef48ecfd996f971aeed399a7dc735d2c8c"}}]
```

*The TUF root keys can be determined by running `tuf root-keys` in the TUF repository.*

### Export components

Export the Flynn components into the TUF repository (this will prompt for TUF key
passphrases):

```
$ script/export-components /path/to/tuf-repo
```

### Upload components

Upload the `repository` directory of the TUF repo to the file server referenced
by `CONFIG_IMAGE_REPOSITORY`.

For example, if using S3 and `CONFIG_IMAGE_REPOSITORY` is set to
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-flynn-repo/tuf`, use `s3cmd` to sync the files:

```
$ s3cmd sync --acl-public /path/to/tuf-repo/repository s3://my-flynn-repo/tuf
```

You can now distribute `script/install-flynn` and run it with an explicit repo URL
to install the custom built Flynn components:

```
install-flynn -r https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-flynn-repo
```
