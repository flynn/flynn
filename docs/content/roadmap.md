# Roadmap

We use [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fenhancement)
to track feature requests. If you see something that you'd like, add a "thumbs
up" reaction to the issue to show your support. Please do a quick search before
filing a new feature request.

The [`roadmap/current`
label](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/labels/roadmap%2Fcurrent) on GitHub provides
a list of larger projects that we are currently working on.

The [`roadmap/upcoming`
label](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/labels/roadmap%2Fupcoming) on GitHub
provides a list of larger projects that we expect to work on next.

If you'd like to contribute to Flynn, take a look at our documentation on
[contributing](https://flynn.io/docs/contributing) and
[development](https://flynn.io/docs/development).
